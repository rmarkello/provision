# provision

A small script for provisioning a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 install. Simply clone this repository, set up the [`config.json`](config.json) as desired (or override entries using command-line arguments), and run! It will install a whole bunch of useful software on your computer with minimal effort.

N.B. There are **very likely** some bugs here. I haven't had a chance to perfect this. Still, it should be better than doing _everything_ by hand...
